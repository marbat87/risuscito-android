Hello dear user brother,<br/>
</p>
<p>
More than 17 months have already passed from the debut of the application He Rose from Death on the Android PlayStore.<br/>
It is constantly updated, in the limits of the time available, and we try to adapt it as we can to your requests.
</p>
<p>
If this application has been useful to you and you liked it, you can phisically thank us through PlayStore, using the buttons at the page bottom (NOTE: 30&#37; goes to Google).
</p>
<p>
We clarify that the application is NOT for pay and, making a donation, does not grant you any added function.<br/>
It is simply a way to recognise the usefullness of the application and reward a bit the time spent to improve it day by day.
</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your generosity.</p>
<p>
Peace.<br/><i>MARBAT87</i>
